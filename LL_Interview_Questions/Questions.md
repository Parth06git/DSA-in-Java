# Question - 1

Remove the dubs from the linked list

# Question - 2

Print Last Nth element of a linked list

# Question - 3

Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.

# Question - 4

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

# Question - 5

Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.
